# Creastrix

> AI Design & Manufacturing Platform

Status: Active early development focused on the backend domain foundation

Version: 0.1.0

## Vision

Creastrix transforms user ideas into manufacturable products using artificial intelligence.

## Current State

Specification approval and implementation coverage are tracked separately.

### APPROVED Domain Specifications

User, User Profile, Organization, Organization Membership, Workspace, Workspace Membership, and Ready-Made Product have APPROVED domain specifications. Approval records the accepted architecture for those entities; it does not mean that every approved rule is already implemented.

Ready-Made Product architecture is APPROVED at version 1.0, but its backend foundation has not been implemented.

### Implemented Backend Foundations

The current backend foundation covers:

- the executable backend bootstrap;
- the User and mandatory User Profile foundation;
- the User repository port with an explicit JDBC persistence adapter;
- the Organization and Organization Membership foundation;
- the Workspace and Workspace Membership structural foundation, including
  User-owned and Organization-owned creation with an atomic initial `ACTIVE`
  `ADMIN` Membership;
- the Workspace repository port with an explicit JDBC persistence adapter and
  V4 PostgreSQL structural-invariant enforcement.

This is a partial foundation, not a complete product implementation or full delivery of every behavior in the approved specifications.

### Remaining DRAFT Domain Areas

The downstream Listing, Order Item, Shipment, and other remaining DRAFT domain
areas are unimplemented and require their own independent specification
approval before ordinary production implementation. Neither the Workspace and
Workspace Membership structural foundation nor Ready-Made Product approval
approves any downstream DRAFT specification.

## Architecture and Technology

- Java 25 and Spring Boot;
- modular monolith;
- Maven Wrapper;
- PostgreSQL with Flyway migrations;
- explicit JDBC repositories;
- PostgreSQL integration tests based on Testcontainers.
